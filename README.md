# ConnectFour
The first game I ever coded with the help of my partner back in high school. This program holds many memories, as a lot of sweat and tears went into this code. Done pretty well for a pair of students in 11th grade if you ask me.

## How to run code
For this code to work, drag and drop the .java file into any java programming compiler, the code for us was written on a software called Eclipse.
And that's it! No really. That's it. Now all you gotta do is run the code, find a friend to play with and enjoy.

## Eclipse
This program was coded on Eclipse, to download Eclipse, visit : https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/ and download their latest release on your compatible device.
